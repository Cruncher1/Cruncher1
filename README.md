- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cruncher1
- 👀 I’m interested in making cool stuff that makes life better. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, RUST, and a sprinkling of just about everything else. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at this time. The time will come for collaboration. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... yell loudly towards the mountains.
